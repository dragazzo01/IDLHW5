Introduction:

In this research project we implement a diffusion model. This model is capable of generating high quality images of a specific subject given training examples in a dataset. For instance the diffiusion model can create a high quality novel image of a cat given a dataset of cat images. Diffusion models are important as they are able to train more stably and generate more diverse, higher quality images than other generative models such as GANs.

Our goal is to minimize the Frechet Inception distance. Given two distributions, N(µr,Σr) and N(µg,Σg), the distance is computed as ||µr −µg||2 +Tr(Σr +Σg −2(ΣrΣg)1/2). 


We use techniques from the following papers: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Ho, Jain, Abbeel), Denoising diffusion implicit models (Song, Meng, Ermon), High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models (Rombach et. al.), Auto-encoding variational bayes (Kingma), and Taming transformers for highresolution image synthesis (Esser et. al).
