packages, or upgrade a particular package),
you could first clone this environment as follows:
    conda create --prefix <path to a dir in which you can write> --clone $ENV
Then activate the newly spawned environment and proceed with your
customization.

To get further help with conda usage, you can try one of the following:
    conda -h
    conda <command> -h

Module Activation
-------------------
The following commands have been executed for activating the module:
